        <p><strong>Are you GST registered? How do you collect the payment?</strong><br>
        I am not GST registered. I usually invoice my clients at the end of each session.</p>
        <p><strong>How long does each session take?</strong><br>
        A session typically lasts 50 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Do you offer sliding scale rates or other discount programmes?</strong><br>
        No. There are however a number of opportunities for funding you can consider, such as insurance, Disability Allowance, Studylink, ACC or employment benefits.</p>
        <p><strong>Can anyone find out what's discussed in session?</strong><br>
        All the sessions are strictly confidential. I can't disclose any details of our engagement without your prior consent. However, in case of the risk to self or others I amy need to work with you in session to report to the appropriate authorities to ensure your safety.</p>
        <p><strong>What is the FACT?</strong><br>
        “Life is one big symptom generator! When you
            stop having symptoms, that’s the day you are
            declared DOA” Strosahl, Robinson and Gustavsson (2012; p.51)<br>
            The newly developed Focused Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (FACT) is the marriage between the GP care and psychology practice for the best interest of our client populations. <br>
            The FACT encourages a shift of thinking so that our clients can learn to become more flexible and resilent psycholigcally, and are able to commit into a preferred lifestyle that is in line with their core values and eventually will give them a greater sense of joy and wellbeing.</p>
